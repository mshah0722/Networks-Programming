Text Conferencing Lab
Section: Additional Features

For this lab we have created 2 new functionalities:
1) Client is able to join multiple sessions. 
2) User Timeout automatically disconnects inactive clients

With the creation of the first added functionality, the user is able to get a list of all the clients and which
session they are in. This list is constantly updated and reflects the latest information.
The user is also able to send messages in multiple session and communicate with the respective students

For the second functionality, we implemented a timeout functionality for users. This functionality works when
the user is logged out and is inactive as well as when they are logged in and they are inactive. This 
feature allows users to protect theit profile, and protect their chat history. If the users are logged in and
they timeout, then they are first logged out, and then they are exited from their session. If the user has not 
yet logged in and they timeout, they are also exitted from the session.
